# Optreg
For visualisation of optimalisation problems

Supports constraints of type constraint >= 0.
There is a lot of room for improvement on this code.

# Usage
- Use R.x and R.y as a replacement for x and y (x_1 and x_2).
- Define your objective function and constraints in the top.
- Adjust the x_interval to get a nice zoom of the plot.
- Adjust level_intervals to get a nice span of levels plotted.
